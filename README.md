# Data Engineering class notes

## Lecture 1

We created our individual notes repo and updated this README.

What are some components of big data?

* social networks
* data analytics
* storage
* NoSQL

Infoviz - how do you display big data sets to the user?

* D3

Data Lifecycle

1. Collection or generation
2. Cleanup
3. Storage
4. Processing/analysis
5. Query/visualize/act

All those steps ^^ are determined by the initial *question*. Typically, step 5 wraps around to step 1 since the results inform iterations on the initial question.
